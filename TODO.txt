************TODO NEXT TIME***********
- Get the ghosts voting screen all set up

- Get the player voting screen all set up
    - Make sure that the total votes is set up to the right number for majority
    - Update server on voting and unvoting
    - Send all the users to the kill screen

************BACKLOG***********  

- When player is eliminated, update in server and then update all data
    - numghosts/numplayers left
    - show player as dead to the other players

- Create Guessing component for ghosts
    - Match guess in text box to the word
- Normal players have waiting screen 
    - Can probably take this from the other waiting screen
- Have a win screen for whoever team
    - Disconnect all players from socket here besides host
    - Have a button to leave lobby or return to game
    - Leaving lobby simply returns to home screen
    - Return to lobby reconnects the user to the socket and joins the game
- When host returns, have a pop up tell him to start a new game so 
  they don't all get the same words
- Handle when player leaves the game
    - Must notify all players and handle all the numplayers/numghosts variables


- Add a hint screen to every players screen in the game
