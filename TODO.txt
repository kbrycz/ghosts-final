************TODO NEXT TIME*********** 
- Work through the bugs in the lobby edit/new game screens
    - problems with code showing up after doing that
    - not updating when you click save and then go right back, updates only after the second TIME

- The game should tell you that you need at least 5 players to play if it is premade, and the numplayers for isCreated
    - Remove the playersLeft stuff
************BACKLOG***********


- Fix up the store screen
- Be able to click out text input to close it
- Make it so the join name screen says "you are about to join Karl's game!" and fix it on createGame




************GENERAL IDEAS***********





************STRETCH***********





************V2 IDEAS***********
- Make it so that the game involves writing in your answers instead
    - In this feature, be able to click on a person and see all of their previous answers.

- Make it so the server saves some data of the people playing to get statistics
